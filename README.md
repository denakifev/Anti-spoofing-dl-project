# Voice Anti-Spoofing System

## Overview

This project is focused on building a **Voice Anti-Spoofing** system that can detect whether a given audio sample is genuine (live human voice) or spoofed (e.g., replay attack, synthesized or converted voice).

Voice anti-spoofing is critical for enhancing the security of speaker verification systems and preventing unauthorized access through voice-based attacks.
